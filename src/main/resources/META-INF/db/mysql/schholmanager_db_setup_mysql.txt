create database db_example; -- Create the new database
create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword'; -- Creates the user
grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost'; -- Gives all the privileges to the new user on the newly created database

It is good security practice that after your database is in production state, you make spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none 
 and revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, then give him 
 only SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.
